QR CODE GENERATOR
This project is a simple web application that allows you to generate QR codes from any text or URL. You can use it to create QR codes for your website, social media, contact information, or anything else.

How to use
To use this application, you need to have a web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can either download the source code from this repository and open the index.html file in your browser, or you can visit the live demo here.

To generate a QR code, simply enter your text or URL in the input box and click the “GENERATE QR CODE” button. The QR code will appear below the input box. You can save the QR code image by right-clicking on it and choosing “Save image as…”.

How it works
This application uses the QR Server API to generate QR codes. The API accepts a text or URL as a parameter and returns an image of the QR code. The application uses JavaScript to send a request to the API with the user’s input and display the image in the imgBox element.

The application also uses some CSS styles and animations to make the user interface more attractive and interactive. The error class is added to the input box when the user enters an empty or invalid input, and the show-img class is added to the imgBox element when the QR code is generated.
